# Bridge Bot

If you commute in most metropolitan areas, your commute time can be dramatically impacted by slow or stopped traffic on a bridge.  This Alexa skill will allow you to determine any traffic incidents on a specific bridge using the Bimg Maps Traffic API.

## Hosting

Bridge Bot is written as a C# Lambda Function. If you want to host your own version of Bridge Bot, you will need to sign up for a [Bing Maps developer account](https://www.bingmapsportal.com/) to get an API key.

## Bridge Database

Initially, the Bridge Bot will have a limited set of bridges that are supported while I work out all of the logic.  Once the skill is fully functioning, I'll work to expand coverage to handle most metropolitan areas of the United States.
